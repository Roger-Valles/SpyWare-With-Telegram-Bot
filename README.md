# Spyware Project with Telegram Bot for Windows  

This project was developed as part of a university cybersecurity assignment to demonstrate how basic programming knowledge can be used to create potentially harmful tools. Specifically, this project is a spyware with communication capabilities through a Telegram bot, designed specifically for the Windows operating system. The goal is to show how quickly and effectively such tools can be developed, even by individuals with basic programming knowledge.

## Project Objective  

The purpose of this project is twofold:  
1. **Demonstrate technical accessibility**: Show how a tool like spyware can be developed by anyone with basic programming skills, highlighting the importance of strengthening system security.  
2. **Analyze security implications**: Provide a controlled environment to understand how such tools work, assess the associated risks, and explore strategies to mitigate these threats.  

## Features  

- **Sensitive Data Capture**: Collects data such as keystrokes, screenshots, and other key system information.  
- **Communication via Telegram**: Uses a Telegram bot to securely send the collected data in real-time to a predefined channel.  
- **Windows Compatibility**: Specifically designed to operate in Windows environments, leveraging system features to run discreetly.
